Our project is called Virus Network, an epidemic simulator that reads
in data from a graph and runs a simulation of the epidemic unfolding. 
It includes a GUI so you can view the spread over time, and it allows 
you to set different parameters to change how the disease spreads. We 
used this simulator to do some analysis on how different factors affect 
the spread of disease. Our project is an implementation project, but we 
used our code to do some empirical analysis as well.

To run our simulation, you must run the main function within the 
GUIVirus.java file. 

Within the simulation, you can set these parameters: infection rate, 
days of contagion, mortality rate, days to vaccination, testing capacity, 
social distancing (true/false), and rate of essential workers. We took 
these parameters from common affecting factors that we have observed in 
the COVID-19 crisis. A green box is someone who is infected and 
contagious, a white box is someone who is healthy and has not contracted 
the virus, a yellow box is someone who has recovered from the virus, a 
black box is someone who has died from the virus, and a red box is 
someone who is quarantined. 

For the division of labor, Xavier built the underlying network with 
appropriately weighted strong and edge weights based on triadic closures 
by reading in data from the Facebook network on Stanford’s Large Network 
Dataset Collection, Alex wrote the code for the simulator’s algorithmic 
graph traversal, and Zach created the GUI for the infection visualization. 
We all collaborated on the writeup and empirical analysis.
